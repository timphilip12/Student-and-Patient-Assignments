# Student
### These are my findings on the student data that can be found in the Student Data folder. There are three tables: Course, Registration and Student. 

After left joining the three table together, I plotted the joined table to see the number of student per course.

Then, I made a chart based on the birth year of the student.

I also made a chart for the total cost per course segmented by payment plan.
