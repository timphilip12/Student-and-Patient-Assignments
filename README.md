# Student
### These are my findings on the student data that can be found in the Student Data folder. There are three tables: Course, Registration and Student. 

After left joining the three table together, I plotted the joined table to see the number of student per course.

Then, I made a chart based on the birth year of the student.

I also made a chart for the total cost per course segmented by payment plan.

And finally, I did the same but with the balance per course also segmented by payment plan.

# Patient
### These are my findings on the patient data that can be found in the Patient Data folder. There are three tables: Billing, Patient and Visit.

After left joining the patient and billing tables together, I plotted the number of visit grouped by reason and segmented per month.

Then, I created a pivot table with the number of visit grouped by reason based on walkin or not

And then, I did the same but based on zip codes this time.
